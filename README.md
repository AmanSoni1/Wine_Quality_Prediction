# Wine_Quality_Prediction

The Wine Quality Prediction project focuses on classifying wines as either Good (class 1) or Poor (class 0) based on several features. 
The features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, 
sulphates, and alcohol, while the output feature is the quality of the wine.
The project employs various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM Classifier. These models aim to 
accurately predict the wine quality and achieve the highest possible accuracy.

After evaluating the models, the project achieves a maximum accuracy of 93%. 
This accuracy represents the models' ability to correctly classify wines as Good or Poor based on the provided features.
The Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM Classifier models all contribute to the high accuracy achieved in this project.

In summary, the Wine Quality Prediction project utilizes multiple machine learning models to classify wines as Good or Poor based on a range of features.
With a maximum accuracy of 93%, these models provide accurate predictions, helping identify the quality of wines. The project highlights the significance 
of the selected features in determining wine quality and demonstrates the effectiveness of the chosen machine learning algorithms in achieving high 
prediction accuracy.
